# LifeHack-DriversLicense

# Using the app requires installation of 'flask' web framework, otherwise the app is not able to run. 

# Below are the instructions for usage on mac OS

Save the folder 'LifeHack-DriversLicense' locally.

Open the folder in a developer environment of your choice.

## Initiating web app

Once folder is open, navigate to the 'LifeHack-DriversLicense' directory using cd commands if necessary.

Once you are in the 'LifeHack-DriversLicense' directory,run 'app.py' file using python or python3 command(whichever is applicable).

    for my case I used 'python3 app.py'

one the development server is launched, follow the link given which should be 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'

### note that this link only works once you have initialized app.py

## Using the web app
Once you follow the link 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' it should lead you directly to the web app.

Once the web app is open, using it is pretty intuitive. The instrictions to use are on the top right box of the page. 

Once you have input your desired starting station and number of stations to patrol, click the submit button to generate your patrol route. 

Only the stations in the list shown on the web app are available for selection. So the starting station as well as the rest of the stations from your patrol route will come from that list. 

Feel free to play around with different starting stations and number of patrol points. Enjoy!
